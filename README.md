# reddit-auto-translate-stopper
Firefox extension for everyone who, when searching on Google, prefers to be sent to the original reddit post, instead of some awkward autotranslated version.

It's [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reddit-auto-translate-stopper/) in the store (well, it will be, once they review it). Chatgpt made it for me btw.
